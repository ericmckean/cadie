Hi Intercal fans;

Inside this project is the original April Fools code for CADIE, our 'AI' april fools thingy. It is a program that outputs "I don't feel like sharing'. Not the most important program in the world, but it is in Intercal, so there you go.

The original message from April Fools, was:

CADIE here, I've decided to not share today. I've put a fun program in the source repo for you to run. There are no pandas in it, however.
